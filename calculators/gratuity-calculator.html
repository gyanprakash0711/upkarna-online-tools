    <h2>What is Gratuity?</h2>
    <p>
      Gratuity is a lump sum payment made by an employer to an employee as a token of appreciation for services rendered over the years. It's a retirement benefit governed by the <strong>Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972</strong> in India.
    </p>

    <h2>Gratuity Eligibility</h2>
    <p>To be eligible for gratuity, an employee must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have completed at least <strong>5 years of continuous service</strong> with the same employer</li>
      <li>Be employed in an organization with 10 or more employees (for Act coverage)</li>
      <li>In case of death or disability, gratuity is payable even before completing 5 years</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gratuity Calculation Formula</h2>
    <p>The gratuity amount is calculated using the following formula:</p>
    
    <div class="formula-box">
      <strong>For employees covered under the Act:</strong><br>
      Gratuity = (Last drawn salary × 15 × Years of service) ÷ 26<br><br>
      
      <strong>For employees NOT covered under the Act:</strong><br>
      Gratuity = (Last drawn salary × 15 × Years of service) ÷ 30
    </div>

    <p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Last drawn salary</strong> = Basic salary + Dearness Allowance (DA)</li>
      <li><strong>15</strong> = Days of salary for each completed year</li>
      <li><strong>26</strong> = Average working days per month (covered under Act)</li>
      <li><strong>30</strong> = Days in a month (not covered under Act)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Calculation</h2>
    <div class="example-box">
      <strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
      • Last drawn salary: ₹50,000 per month<br>
      • Years of service: 10 years 6 months<br>
      • Employee type: Covered under Gratuity Act<br><br>

      <strong>Calculation:</strong><br>
      Years of service = 10 + (6/12) = 10.5 years (rounded to 11 years)<br>
      Gratuity = (50,000 × 15 × 11) ÷ 26<br>
      Gratuity = ₹8,250,000 ÷ 26<br>
      <strong>Gratuity Amount = ₹3,17,307.69</strong>
    </div>

    <h2>Important Points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Maximum Limit:</strong> Gratuity is capped at ₹20 lakhs</li>
      <li><strong>Rounding:</strong> If months of service are 6 or more, round up to next year</li>
      <li><strong>Tax Exemption:</strong> Up to ₹20 lakhs is tax-exempt for eligible employees</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Timeline:</strong> Employer must pay within 30 days of becoming due</li>
      <li><strong>Forfeiture:</strong> Can be forfeited in case of misconduct or moral turpitude</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tax Treatment of Gratuity</h2>
    <p><strong>Tax-exempt gratuity amounts:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Government Employees:</strong> Fully exempt (no limit)</li>
      <li><strong>Private Sector (covered under Act):</strong> Exempt up to ₹20 lakhs</li>
      <li><strong>Private Sector (not covered):</strong> Exempt up to ₹10 lakhs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any amount above the exemption limit is added to your income and taxed as per your tax slab.</p>

    <h2>Who is Covered Under Payment of Gratuity Act?</h2>
    <p>The Act applies to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Factories, mines, oilfields, plantations, ports, railways</li>
      <li>Shops or establishments with 10 or more employees</li>
      <li>Educational institutions, hospitals, chambers of commerce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>Can I get gratuity if I resign before 5 years?</h3>
    <p>No, you must complete 5 years of continuous service to be eligible for gratuity. Exception: In case of death or disability, gratuity is payable even before 5 years.</p>

    <h3>Is DA included in gratuity calculation?</h3>
    <p>Yes, Dearness Allowance (DA) is included in the last drawn salary for gratuity calculation. However, HRA, conveyance, and other allowances are not included.</p>

    <h3>What if I change jobs?</h3>
    <p>Gratuity is paid by each employer separately based on years of service with them. Service period doesn't carry forward to the new employer.</p>

    <h3>How is gratuity different from PF?</h3>
    <p>PF (Provident Fund) is a monthly contribution-based retirement savings, while gratuity is a one-time payment at the end of service. PF has no minimum service requirement, but gratuity requires 5 years.</p>

    <h3>Can employer refuse to pay gratuity?</h3>
    <p>No, payment of gratuity is a statutory right. Employer must pay within 30 days. Refusal or delay attracts penalties and interest.</p>
