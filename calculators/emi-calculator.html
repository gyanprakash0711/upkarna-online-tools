    <h2>What is EMI? (Simple Explanation)</h2>
    <p>
      EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is the fixed amount you pay every month to repay a loan. Each EMI includes
      two parts: interest (the cost of borrowing) and principal (the amount you borrowed). At the start of the loan, the interest
      portion is higher, and as months pass, the principal portion grows. This is called amortization. Because the EMI stays the
      same every month in a fixed-rate loan, it becomes easier to plan your cash flow and budget for other goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practical terms, EMI is your monthly commitment to the bank. Whether it is a home loan, car loan, or personal loan, EMI
      tells you how much of your salary needs to be set aside each month. If you compare loans from different lenders, EMI is the
      first number you look at, but it is not the only number. You should also compare the total interest paid over the entire
      tenure and the total amount repaid. This EMI calculator helps you see all three.
    </p>

    <h2>EMI Formula with Example</h2>
    <p>
      The standard EMI formula is:
      <br>
      <code>EMI = P × r × (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Where <strong>P</strong> is the principal (loan amount), <strong>r</strong> is the monthly interest rate, and <strong>n</strong> is the total
      number of monthly installments. To convert the annual rate to a monthly rate, divide by 12 and by 100. For example, if your
      annual interest rate is 8.5%, the monthly rate is 8.5 / 12 / 100 = 0.007083.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: Loan amount P = ₹50,00,000, annual rate = 8.5%, tenure = 20 years. Then n = 20 × 12 = 240 months.
      Plugging in the numbers gives an EMI of around ₹43,400. Over 20 years, the total repayment becomes roughly ₹1.04 crore,
      and the total interest paid is about ₹54 lakh. These numbers are approximate and can vary slightly due to rounding.
    </p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Calculation</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to calculate EMI manually, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1: Write down the loan amount (principal) in rupees.</li>
      <li>Step 2: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate by dividing by 12 and by 100.</li>
      <li>Step 3: Convert tenure in years to months by multiplying by 12.</li>
      <li>Step 4: Apply the EMI formula using the values of P, r, and n.</li>
      <li>Step 5: Multiply EMI by n to get total repayment, then subtract P to estimate total interest.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most borrowers use a calculator because manual calculation is error-prone, but understanding these steps helps you spot
      incorrect quotes or marketing claims that look too good to be true.
    </p>

    <h2>How Interest Affects EMI</h2>
    <p>
      Interest rate is the biggest driver of EMI. Even a 0.5% change can noticeably shift your monthly payment, especially for
      long tenures. For example, on a ₹50 lakh home loan for 20 years, moving from 8.5% to 9.0% can push EMI up by more than ₹1,500
      per month. That might feel small, but over 240 months it can add several lakhs in extra interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interest also affects the early months of the loan more because the outstanding principal is high. As a result, if you
      prepay early, your interest savings are much larger. This is why banks sometimes charge prepayment fees or allow only a
      limited number of extra payments each year. If your loan is floating rate, the bank may adjust either your EMI amount or your
      loan tenure when rates move. Always check which method your lender uses.
    </p>

    <h2>Prepayment Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Prepayment means paying more than the scheduled EMI to reduce the principal. There are three common strategies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Occasional lump-sum prepayment:</strong> Use bonuses or savings to pay a chunk once or twice a year.</li>
      <li><strong>Regular extra payment:</strong> Add a fixed amount (e.g., ₹2,000) to your EMI every month.</li>
      <li><strong>Part prepayment with tenure reduction:</strong> Keep the EMI same and reduce tenure to save maximum interest.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If your primary goal is to reduce overall interest, choose tenure reduction. If your goal is to reduce monthly burden, choose
      EMI reduction. Most borrowers in India prefer tenure reduction because it saves more money in the long run.
    </p>

    <h2>Real Indian Examples</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Home loan example:</strong> A borrower takes a ₹35 lakh home loan for 15 years at 8.25% interest. The EMI is about
      ₹34,000. If they prepay ₹2 lakh after the third year and keep EMI constant, the tenure can reduce by around 10 to 12 months,
      saving a substantial amount of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Car loan example:</strong> A ₹8 lakh car loan for 5 years at 10.5% interest results in an EMI of roughly ₹17,200.
      If the borrower chooses a 6-year tenure instead, EMI drops to about ₹14,700 but the total interest paid increases
      significantly. This shows the trade-off between affordability and cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Personal loan example:</strong> A ₹2 lakh personal loan for 2 years at 14% interest has an EMI of around ₹9,600. If
      the borrower makes an extra payment of ₹20,000 in the first six months, the interest savings can be more than the interest
      saved by the same prepayment in the second year.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Mistakes Borrowers Make</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using annual interest rate directly without converting to monthly rate.</li>
      <li>Entering tenure in years when the calculator expects months (or the other way around).</li>
      <li>Ignoring processing fees and insurance premiums that increase the total cost.</li>
      <li>Assuming lower EMI always means cheaper loan (longer tenure can cost more).</li>
      <li>Not reviewing floating-rate reset clauses and how often rates can change.</li>
      <li>Skipping prepayment options even when surplus funds are available early in the loan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Does EMI change when interest changes?</h3>
    <p>
      In floating-rate loans, EMI or tenure can change after a rate reset. For fixed-rate loans, EMI usually remains constant.
    </p>

    <h3>Can EMI be reduced after the loan starts?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. You can reduce EMI by making a part prepayment, extending the tenure, or refinancing to a lower interest rate.
    </p>

    <h3>Is prepayment better than EMI reduction?</h3>
    <p>
      If you want to save interest, prepayment with tenure reduction is generally better. EMI reduction helps when you need lower
      monthly outflow.
    </p>

    <h3>How accurate are online EMI calculators?</h3>
    <p>
      They are accurate for standard amortization-based loans, but the final EMI may differ slightly due to lender rounding,
      processing fees, or special rate terms.
    </p>

    <h3>What happens if I miss an EMI?</h3>
    <p>
      Missed EMIs can attract penalties, impact your credit score, and increase overall loan cost. Always contact your lender if
      you foresee a delay.
    </p>

    <h3>Should I choose a longer tenure to lower EMI?</h3>
    <p>
      A longer tenure reduces EMI but increases total interest paid. Choose a tenure that balances comfort and total cost.
    </p>

    <h3>Does the EMI include insurance or processing fees?</h3>
    <p>
      EMI usually covers only principal and interest. Some lenders bundle insurance or fees separately, so check your sanction
      letter for the exact breakup.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I switch from floating to fixed rate later?</h3>
    <p>
      Many banks allow a rate switch or balance transfer, but it may involve fees. Compare savings before switching.
