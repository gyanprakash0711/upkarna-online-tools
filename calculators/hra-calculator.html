    <h2>What is HRA (House Rent Allowance)?</h2>
    <p>House Rent Allowance (HRA) is a salary component provided by employers to employees to meet their accommodation expenses. HRA forms a significant part of the salary structure for salaried individuals in India. Under Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act, a portion of HRA is exempt from tax, which helps reduce your overall tax liability.</p>
    
    <p>The HRA exemption is designed to provide relief to employees who live in rented accommodation. Not all of the HRA received is tax-exempt; only a calculated portion based on specific criteria is exempted. The remaining amount is added to your taxable income. Understanding how HRA exemption works is crucial for tax planning and maximizing your take-home salary.</p>

    <p>Our HRA Calculator helps you instantly determine how much of your HRA is tax-exempt and how much is taxable. This is essential for accurate tax planning, filling ITR forms, and understanding your salary breakup better.</p>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>How is HRA Exemption Calculated?</h2>
    <p>HRA exemption is calculated as per the rules specified under Section 10(13A) of the Income Tax Act. The exemption is the <strong>minimum</strong> of the following three amounts:</p>
    
    <div class="formula-box">
      <h3>HRA Exemption Formula:</h3>
      <p><strong>The MINIMUM of:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Actual HRA received</strong> from employer</li>
        <li><strong>50% of Basic Salary</strong> (for metro cities) <br>OR<br> <strong>40% of Basic Salary</strong> (for non-metro cities)</li>
        <li><strong>Rent Paid minus 10% of Basic Salary</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Basic Salary = Basic + Dearness Allowance (DA)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <h3>Example Calculation:</h3>
      <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Employee in Mumbai (Metro City)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic Salary: ₹50,000/month</li>
        <li>HRA Received: ₹20,000/month</li>
        <li>Rent Paid: ₹15,000/month</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Calculation:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Actual HRA = ₹20,000</li>
        <li>50% of Basic = 50% × ₹50,000 = ₹25,000</li>
        <li>Rent - 10% of Basic = ₹15,000 - (10% × ₹50,000) = ₹15,000 - ₹5,000 = ₹10,000</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>HRA Exemption = Minimum(₹20,000, ₹25,000, ₹10,000) = ₹10,000/month</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Taxable HRA = ₹20,000 - ₹10,000 = ₹10,000/month</strong></p>

    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is the taxable HRA amount?</h3>
      <p>Taxable HRA = Actual HRA received - HRA exemption. The exempted amount is calculated as the minimum of three values: actual HRA, 50%/40% of salary, and rent minus 10% of salary. The remaining HRA is taxable.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to submit rent receipts to my employer every month?</h3>
