    <h2>About SIP Calculator</h2>
    <p>Our <strong>SIP Calculator</strong> helps you plan your Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) investments in mutual funds. Calculate how much wealth you can build through regular monthly investments.</p>

    <h3>What is SIP?</h3>
    <p>SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is a method of investing a fixed amount regularly in mutual funds. Instead of investing a large sum at once, you invest small amounts monthly, which helps in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Rupee Cost Averaging:</strong> Buy more units when prices are low, fewer when prices are high</li>
      <li><strong>Disciplined Investing:</strong> Auto-debit ensures you invest regularly without procrastination</li>
      <li><strong>Power of Compounding:</strong> Your returns generate returns, exponentially growing your wealth</li>
      <li><strong>Lower Risk:</strong> Spreading investment over time reduces market timing risk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Use This Calculator</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Monthly Investment:</strong> Enter the amount you want to invest every month (e.g., ₹5,000)</li>
      <li><strong>Expected Return:</strong> Enter expected annual return rate (typically 10-15% for equity mutual funds)</li>
      <li><strong>Time Period:</strong> Enter investment duration in years (recommended minimum 5 years)</li>
      <li>Click "Calculate SIP" to see projected returns</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Understanding the Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Invested Amount:</strong> Total money you will invest (Monthly SIP × Number of months)</li>
      <li><strong>Wealth Gained:</strong> Returns earned on your investment (Expected Amount - Invested Amount)</li>
      <li><strong>Expected Amount:</strong> Total corpus you'll accumulate (Principal + Returns)</li>
      <li><strong>Year-wise Breakdown:</strong> See how your investment grows each year</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SIP Formula</h3>
    <p>The SIP calculator uses the future value of annuity formula:</p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      <strong>FV = P × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r] × (1 + r)</strong>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>FV</strong> = Future Value (Expected Amount)</li>
        <li><strong>P</strong> = Monthly Investment Amount</li>
        <li><strong>r</strong> = Monthly Return Rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong> = Total Number of Payments (Years × 12)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Benefits of SIP Investment</h3>
    <h4>1. Start Small, Grow Big</h4>
    <p>You can start SIP with as low as ₹500 per month. No need to wait for a large sum. Small regular investments can build significant wealth over time.</p>

    <h4>2. Rupee Cost Averaging</h4>
    <p>When markets are high, you buy fewer units. When markets are low, you buy more units. This averages out your purchase cost and reduces risk.</p>

    <h4>3. Power of Compounding</h4>
    <p>Your returns earn returns. A ₹10,000 monthly SIP for 20 years at 12% annual return can grow to over ₹1 crore!</p>

    <h4>4. Flexibility</h4>
    <p>You can increase, decrease, pause, or stop your SIP anytime. No lock-in period for regular mutual funds (except ELSS).</p>

    <h3>SIP Investment Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stay Invested Long-Term:</strong> Minimum 5 years for equity funds, preferably 10+ years</li>
      <li><strong>Increase SIP Annually:</strong> Increase by 10-15% every year to match salary increments (Step-up SIP)</li>
      <li><strong>Don't Stop During Market Falls:</strong> Market corrections are best times to accumulate units</li>
      <li><strong>Diversify:</strong> Invest in 3-4 different types of funds (large cap, mid cap, index)</li>
      <li><strong>Review Annually:</strong> Check fund performance once a year, not daily or weekly</li>
      <li><strong>Set Clear Goals:</strong> Invest for specific goals (retirement, child education, house down payment)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ Stopping SIP during market corrections (biggest mistake!)</li>
      <li>❌ Expecting quick returns in 1-2 years</li>
      <li>❌ Checking portfolio value daily and panicking</li>
      <li>❌ Investing without clear financial goals</li>
      <li>❌ Not increasing SIP amount with salary growth</li>
      <li>❌ Putting all money in one fund or sector</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    
    <h4>Q: How accurate is this SIP calculator?</h4>
    <p>This calculator assumes a constant rate of return, which is a simplification. Actual mutual fund returns vary year by year. Use this for planning and estimation, not as a guaranteed outcome.</p>

    <h4>Q: Can I stop SIP anytime?</h4>
    <p>Yes! SIP has no lock-in period (except ELSS tax-saving funds which have 3 years). You can pause or stop anytime, but staying invested is recommended for long-term wealth creation.</p>

    <h4>Q: What if I miss a SIP installment?</h4>
    <p>If your bank account has insufficient balance, that month's SIP will be skipped. Most mutual funds allow up to 3 missed installments before auto-canceling the SIP mandate.</p>

    <h4>Q: Should I invest lumpsum or SIP?</h4>
    <p>SIP is better for regular income earners and beginners. Lumpsum works when you have a large amount and markets are down. Consider a hybrid approach - do SIP regularly and add lumpsum during market corrections. Read our <a href="../blog/sip-vs-lumpsum-investment.html">detailed SIP vs Lumpsum comparison</a>.</p>

    <h4>Q: What is the minimum SIP amount?</h4>
    <p>Most mutual funds allow SIP starting from ₹500 per month. However, for meaningful wealth creation, aim for at least ₹5,000-10,000 monthly based on your income.</p>

    <h4>Q: Can I have multiple SIPs?</h4>
    <p>Absolutely! You can run multiple SIPs in different mutual fund schemes. This helps in diversification and goal-based investing.</p>
