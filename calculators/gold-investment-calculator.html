    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>Q: How much gold should I own?</h3>
    <p>Financial experts recommend 10-15% of your investment portfolio in gold. This provides adequate diversification without over-exposure to a non-income generating asset.</p>

    <h3>Q: Is 24K gold better than 22K for investment?</h3>
    <p>For investment, 24K (99.9% pure) is better as it has higher resale value and no making charges. 22K is suitable for jewelry due to better durability.</p>

    <h3>Q: Should I buy physical gold or digital gold?</h3>
    <p>For investment purposes, digital gold or SGB is better due to lower costs and no storage hassles. Physical gold is suitable if you need it for occasions or prefer tangible assets.</p>

    <h3>Q: What is the best time to sell gold?</h3>
    <p>Sell when gold prices are 15-20% above your purchase price or when you need to rebalance portfolio. For tax efficiency, hold for 3+ years to get indexation benefits.</p>

    <h3>Q: Can I do SIP in gold?</h3>
    <p>Yes! You can invest regularly in gold through Digital Gold SIP (Google Pay, PhonePe), Gold Mutual Fund SIP, or by buying SGBs in every issue. Monthly SIP of ₹1,000-5,000 in gold is ideal.</p>

    <h3>Q: Is gold better than FD for savings?</h3>
    <p>Gold typically outperforms FD in the long term (5+ years) but comes with price volatility. FDs are better for short-term goals and guaranteed returns. Ideally, have both in your portfolio.</p>
